## Finetuning Overview
This **Generative AI** project demonstrates the fine-tuning of the Llama 2 large language model on an open assistant-style dataset to adapt it for enhanced natural language processing (NLP) responses. Llama 2 is a state-of-the-art pre-trained model capable of generating coherent and contextually relevant text. While it excels in general-purpose language understanding, fine-tuning is essential to tailor its performance for domain-specific applications. The fine-tuned model was trained using parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques and pushed to the Hugging Face Hub for accessibility and reuse by the broader community. Additionally, a separate notebook was created to showcase how to use the fine-tuned model for inference.

## Technologies Used
The project leverages the following tools and frameworks:
- **Google Colab**: For environment setup and running resource-intensive training tasks in the cloud.
- **Hugging Face Transformers**: To load, fine-tune, and manage the Llama 2 model.
- **PEFT (Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning)**: For efficient training without modifying the full set of model weights.
- **Pytorch**: For tensor computations and model optimization during training.
- **Hugging Face Hub**: To save and share the fine-tuned model for reuse by others.
- **Tokenization & Preprocessing Tools**: For preparing the dataset and formatting input-output pairs.

## Approach Taken
The project followed a systematic approach to fine-tune the Llama 2 model and make it suitable for the custom NLP task:
1. **Dataset Preparation**:
   - The dataset was analyzed and preprocessed, including cleaning, tokenization, and formatting for compatibility with the Llama 2 tokenizer.
   - Features such as padding and truncation were applied to ensure uniform input lengths.
   
2. **Model Loading and Configuration**:
   - The pre-trained Llama 2 model was loaded using the Hugging Face `transformers` library.
   - Key hyperparameters like maximum sequence length, batch size, learning rate, and number of training epochs were configured.

3. **Fine-Tuning**:
   - PEFT techniques like QLoRA (Quantised Low-Rank Adaptation) were employed to fine-tune the model efficiently with limited resources.
   - The training process was monitored, and checkpoints were periodically saved.

4. **Evaluation and Validation**:
   - The fine-tuned model was evaluated on test queries, and responsees were analyzed to ensure improvements in the outputs.

5. **Model Deployment and Inference**:
   - The fine-tuned model was pushed to the Hugging Face Hub for public access.
   - A separate test notebook was created to demonstrate how to use the fine-tuned model for inference.

## Outcome Achieved
- **Fine-Tuned Llama 2 Model**: A highly customized Llama 2 model, fine-tuned on an open assistant-styled dataset, was created to improve the quality of responses on various queries.
- **Model Availability**: The fine-tuned model was successfully uploaded to the Hugging Face Hub, allowing others to reuse it with minimal setup.
- **Inference Notebook**: A test notebook was developed to showcase how the fine-tuned model can be used for making predictions on new data.

## Conclusion
This project highlights the power of fine-tuning large language models like Llama 2 for solving domain-specific NLP problems. By leveraging advanced tools such as Hugging Face's `transformers` and PEFT techniques, the fine-tuning process was both resource-efficient and effective. The model's deployment to the Hugging Face Hub makes it accessible for others to reuse and build upon. This project serves as a blueprint for adapting pre-trained models to specialized applications, showcasing the flexibility and scalability of modern NLP frameworks. Future work could involve exploring other parameter-efficient approaches, incorporating larger datasets, and further optimizing the model's performance.
